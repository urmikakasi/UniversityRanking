ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNjM1liQUhREAE,I personally feel my college gives a wode range of opportunities to each and everyone who want to achieve something in their feild of intrest whatever it may be academics of extra ciricullar activities  Fee Structure And Facilities  The only drawback I feel about the college is fee structure. The fee is quite large amount. A student need to pay around 3.2 lakhs of tution fee and a fee of 80 thousand for hostel and food if one is doesn't get any scholarship and this structure keep changing.  Placement Wing  10/10  Placement scenario is also very good.Being one of the tier-A college in India the average package ranges between 14 lakhs and 16 lakhs.The highest package usually crosses one crore and most probably there will be 100% placements  Hostel Facilities  10/10  I currently live in a hostel. I'm a sophomore and I could opt for a single occupancy room or a double occupancy. I've opted for a double occupancy room.It has a very good infrastructure. They give you a cot a table a chair a white board etc.  Alumni  My college has extra ordinary alumni network. Alumni are very helping and are always constantly helping to take the college forward. Alumni meets/reunion take place very frequently and they guide you about the life outside and after bits.  Faculty  10/10  The faculty is very good.Everyone has completed their Ph.D and are very passionate about teaching. Our college is one of the best colleges for faculty in India if you want to carry forward your reasearch work.  Campus Life  10/10  My college has a very good infrastructure and advanced sports facilities and laboratories. We get a lot of free time to develope our skills in a sport that we used to play or even their are handfull of opportunities to learn a new sport/music instrument etc.  Course Curriculum Overview  10/10  The course curriculum is very flexible and you have a freedom to make your own timetable and opt for the courses of your choice which no other college in India provides.But there are a lot of exams that you have to write and the institute is very keen about transparency of exams.  College Events  10/10  There are many events that occur in my college. There are three fests we celebrate every year.they are BOSM(sports fest) OASIS(cultural fest) APOGEE(technical fest).Among the three oasis being the second largest cultual fest is celebrated on a high scale.Apart from these there are many events that go through out the year  Loan/ Scholarship Provisions  My college gives scholarships on two criteria.The first one is Merit and the other one is Merit cum need scholarship. Out of the two if you need to avail the first one there is CGPA cutoff of about 9.7 and to avail the second one there is a CGPA cutoff of 6.1 and annual income cutoff of 10 LPA.,5.0,0.994,Positive,4,4.5,5

The masters programme in electronics began in 1955.[19]  Reacting to criticism about the project, Drew said:  In my judgment to attempt to develop an American institution in India would be like trying to graft apples on a pine tree. We have not been asked to make such an attempt. We were asked to help devise in India an Indian technological school to produce graduates with the know-how to produce knowledge pertinent for India…. In many respects they consider us immature, rude, hypocritical barbarians who in certain respects happened to hit it lucky. To be viable in India an institution must be framed with Indian values in mind. Birla Institute of Technolog Science, Pilani is located in IndiaPilaniPilaniGoaGoaHyderabadHyderabad Campuses Within India: Pilani, Goa, Hyderabad In 1999, enrollment expanded from 2,500 to 4,000[23] and campuses were founded in Dubai (2000) and Goa (2004). In 2006, BITS Pilani acquired 200 acres (81 ha) of land from the Andhra Pradesh government through the Hyderabad Urban Development Authority for a new campus. The land is located in Jawaharnagar, Shameerpet Mandal in the Rangareddy district.[24] The BITS Pilani Hyderabad campus opened in 2008; the school also has a virtual university[25] and an extension center in Bangalore.[26]  Chancellor and academic head Edit BITS Pilani has a tradition of long-serving chancellors and vice-chancellors. Its founder, G.D. Birla, was chancellor from the college's inception until his death in 1983.[23] He was followed by his son, Krishna Kumar Birla, who was chancellor until his death in 2008.[27] Currently, Kumar Mangalam Birla is chancellor and Shobhana Bhartia is pro-chancellor.[28]  The first academic head of the institution was J. C. Stracliff (Principal) and V. Lakshminarayanan (Vice-Principal) for a period of 3 years during 1946-1949.[29] V. Lakshminarayan became Principal of Birla Engineering College in 1949 (served from 1946 to 1963 in Birla Engineering College), then becoming the first Director of BITS-Pilani in 1964 when it was formed and served till 1969.[30] He was succeeded by BITS directors C.R. Mitra (1969–1989)[31] and S. Venkateswaran (1989–2006). ""director"" denoted the head of a campus.  Under Prof S. Venkateswaran's leadership, the University grew significantly. He was instrumental in expanding BITS, Pilani to establish the other 3 campuses in Goa, Dubai and Hyderabad. With the advent of multiple campuses, the overall head was known as ""vice-chancellor""; As a result, Dr. Venkateswaran became the first Vice Chancellor leading all campuses in 2001.  After his retirement, Prof. L.K. Maheshwari becase the second Vice Chancellor in 2006 and kept office till 2010 when he was succeeded by Prof. Bijendra Nath Jain who held office till 2015. The director of BITS Pilani, Hyderabad campus, Prof. VS Rao took over in August 2015 as the 'Acting Vice chancellor' while the search was on for a suitable candidate to hold the top post in BITS Pilani. In April 2016, Chancellor Kumar Mangalam Birla announced that Prof. Souvik Bhattacharya of IIT Kharagpur / Jadavpur University was selected to take over as the new Vice chancellor of BITS Pilani. He is stated to take over in June 2016 to become the 6th academic head of the institute.[32]",4.0,0.8271,Positive,4,4.0,4

The primary motive of BITS is to ""train young men and women able and eager to create and put into action such ideas, methods, techniques and information"". The Institute is a dream come true of its founder late Mr G.D.Birla - an eminent industrialist, a participant in Indian freedom struggle and a close associate of the Father of Indian Nation late Mr. Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (Mahatma Gandhi). What started in early 1900s as a small school, blossomed into a set of colleges for higher education, ranging from the Humanities to Engineering until 1964 when all these colleges amalgamated to culminate into a unique Indian University of International standing. This university was christened as the Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, known to many as BITS, Pilani.  Over the years, BITS has provided the highest quality technical education to students from all over India admitted on the basis of merit. Its graduates may be found throughout the world in all areas of engineering, science and commerce.

For ECE and EEE, the package offered is around 12 LPA. About 95% of the students were placed in the core placements, which is also pretty good with companies like Qualcomm, Intel, Schlumberger and Shell. The average package offered was around 10 LPA.The median package offered is around 14-15 LPA. The placements are average for ET/MF department. You have to score a decent CGPA and have a couple of projects to get placed in the tier 1 companies. The placements for other departments like finance and analytics are improving. The civil and chemical have not such impressive placements, but if you're good, then you will get placed. The students of remaining branches tend to sit for the sectors mentioned above, but if you have an impressive resume, BITS-H can make you get placed from any branch.  Infrastructure : Bits Pilani, Hyderabad campus, has great infrastructure. Especially, the auditorium, which is one of the biggest and best in Asia is present here. It also has on of the best libraries in India, which can house around 1000 students. All research labs are well-equipped, and hostel rooms are well maintained.
